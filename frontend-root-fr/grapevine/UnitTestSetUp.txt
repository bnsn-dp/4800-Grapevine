To start Unit testing
    1. Ensure that these libraries are installed:
        - npm i -D vitest
        - npm i -D jsdom @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
    2. CD into 4800-GrapeVine/frontend-root-fr/grapevine
    3. Open Terminal and run `npm test`
        - This will open a general test framework that will run all testing files
        - It will show all passed tests and failed tests. As well it will show which test files
          passed / failed the tests.
    4. Create a new test file `testName.test.jsx`
        - Have these imports to assist in creation of unit tests:
            import { describe, test, expect, vi } from 'vitest';
            import { render, screen, fireEvent, getByText } from '@testing-library/react';
            import { MemoryRouter, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';
            # These last two are important to extend the usage of the unit test to include jest-dom 
            # test cases and expected outputs such as .isVisiable
            import matchers from '@testing-library/jest-dom/matchers';
            expect.extend(matchers);
    5. Create Unit Tests
        - Always follows this format:
            describe("description of unit test file", () => {
                test('description of a single unit test', () =>{
                    # code to test functionality of aspect of test#
                    expect(# some form of output based on the code written#)
                })
            })
    6. Debug the test
        - Vitest gives a description of the issue that caused the failed test. Adjust the test to ensure
          correct testing requirements and then adjust the code being tested.
